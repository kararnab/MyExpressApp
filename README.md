Express Mock App
==========

This is a webapp built to support the initial works of my Android projects. This is a mock, built on express js, using node v9.11.

Let's get started
----
`nodemon` redeploys the file in server when the source code changes. Thus we don't have to manually restart the server again and again

**Using atom?**

Try `Ctrl+Shift+M` toggles the gitHub md preview.

Installing **Nodemon**
----
Just use *nodemon* instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. To install, get node.js, then from your terminal run:

`npm install -g nodemon`

Running the server
----
`nodemon filename.js`
